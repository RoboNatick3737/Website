# Angular Seed

I've found that I have a tendency to repeat many steps to create a new Angular app, so this just streamlines the steps involved.  

## Includes

- Bootstrap 4 CSS and ng-bootstrap
- Routing module
- App Component and other frameworks.  
- GitHub 404 Fix (if hosted on pages).   
- Animations Module
